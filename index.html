            <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up in a small village in Eastern Equatoria, South Sudan. I walked 10 km to school
              barefoot to pursue education while navigating culture, conflict, and early pressures to marry.
              Those experiences shaped my resilience, my commitment to equity, and my belief that learning
              can transform communities. I bring that same determination and perspective to every team I join.

            <h3>EQOL Recovery Research Motivation</h3>
            <p>
              I am drawn to EQOL Recovery research because it reframes recovery as a measurable, equity-centered
              outcome for children with medical complexity. Growing up in South Sudan, I saw children survive
              acute trauma only to face lifelong disability without rehabilitative care. My Stanford research
              experience taught me to identify patterns in complex human experiences and connect them to system change.
              I aim to build a career shaping pediatric health policy so that recovery systems serve all children,
              not just those with privilege.

            <h3>Why Pediatrics + Clinical Research</h3>
            <p>
              Pediatrics calls me because healing should restore a child's chance to simply be a child again.
              During South Sudan's 2016 war, I watched children endure trauma without follow-up care. As a
              first-generation, low-income student, I understand what it means to navigate systems without a map.
              Clinical research offers the tools to measure recovery in more than lab values, but in regained joy,
              stability, and belonging.
